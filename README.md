# Runnable-JAR-Generator
## Generate a Runnable JAR in 3 steps! (no Elipse IDE or wrapper classes or JAR commands required)
#### A Java application to generate a Runnable JAR file from your built JAR outputs (e.g. from NetBeans IDE).

#### Illustration:
* Step 1. Select application JAR file (in NetBeans, this is usually built and output into the dist folder)

* Step 2. Select all external JAR libs which are depencies of the Java application (in NetBeans, this is usually output into the dist/lib folder)

#### On completion, the folder containing the final output shall be automatically displayed:
![Runnable JAR is successfully generated](https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*z9sOTVnsrITvECCTIi_rhg.png)

#### Output folder is named as “extracted_<timestamp>”, where `<timestamp>` is generated by the application

#### Sample files to test are included: [demo folder](https://github.com/incubated-geek-cc/Runnable-JAR-Generator/tree/main/demo)

#### Built with Java version 8 on Windows OS (application is platform independent)

#### No External `JAR` libraries included
