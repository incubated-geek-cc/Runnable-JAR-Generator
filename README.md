# Runnable-JAR-Generator
## Generate a Runnable JAR in 3 steps! (no Elipse IDE or wrapper classes or JAR commands required)
#### A Java application to generate a Runnable JAR file from your built JAR outputs (e.g. from NetBeans IDE).

---

## Illustration:

#### Step 1. Select application JAR file (in NetBeans, this is usually built and output into the dist folder)

#### Step 2. Select all external JAR libs which are depencies of the Java application (in NetBeans, this is usually output into the dist/lib folder)

#### On completion, the folder containing the final output shall be automatically displayed:
